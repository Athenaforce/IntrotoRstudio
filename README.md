# Lab0a_Intro_to_R
 This lab serves as an introduction to the RStudio interface and basic R functions. 
 
 To complete this lab, your tasks are to :    
* Create a new RMarkdown document  
* In that document, practice all of the commands introduced in Lab 0a, making sure to comment the code (ie. explain what the command is doing).    
* Answer any questions from Lab 0a, using a combination of code and markdown.  
* Add 2-3 sentences at the end of your RMarkdown document reflecting on your first experience with R - what was difficult? what was easy? 
* Commit changes at regular intervals using Git    
* Turn in the assignment using a pull request on Github.  
 
 I will provide informal (ie. not recorded in the gradebook) feedback on :  
 
STANDARD 7. Practice effective self-sufficient troubleshooting  
* Did you complete the reflection?  

STANDARD 8. Effectively communicate data analysis  
* Is your code clearly and correctly commented?
* Are you using markdown text effectively to narrarate your data analysis?
